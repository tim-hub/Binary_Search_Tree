## Binary Search Tree
This is binary search tree structure written in C. In therory, it can be build by anc C compiler, this is tested on GCC (clang-900.0.39.2) and onligdb c compiler.

This is for building a simple binary search tree, this work is developed through C programming lanaguage.

Platform:

- GCC Version: (Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0)
- Online Complier (https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler)
Author: Tim

## Achieved
- create tree
- insert node
- get count of nodes
- get height of tree
- empty tree (delete all nodes)
- delete tree (delete all nodes and header)
- delete node
- populating

## How to use

```
  gcc ./Tree.c
  ./a.out
```
There are some sample code in `main function`, comment them or uncomment them can be easily test these codes.
